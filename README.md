This badge shows the **real-time operational status** of selected AI models from OpenRouter.


Each badge displays:
- **Model name**: The model's identifier 
- **Status**:
  -  `operational` ‚Äì model is healthy (uptime ‚â• 90%)
  -  `Degraded` ‚Äì degraded performance (uptime ‚â• 50%)
  -  `offline` ‚Äì not available (uptime < 50%)
- **Uptime**: The average uptime over the past 30 minutes 

Clicking the badge opens the live SVG endpoint.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**:  
> A `Degraded` does **not** mean the model is completely unusable.  
> It simply indicates that **some requests may fail intermittently** due to degraded uptime or performance.

This badge shows the real-time operational status of the Kimi model.

## üöÄ Getting Started

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Before starting, make sure to set up all required environment variables in a `.env` file as described in the Environment Variables section below. The application will not work properly without these configurations.

1. Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/palakash26/portfolio2025-main.git
cd portfolio
npm install
```

2. Update your personal information:

```bash
# Edit the components/character/character.ts file with your own details
# This is crucial for the AI to represent you correctly
```

3. Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> **Note:** The first run will take longer than usual as the system creates and saves your embeddings to the vector database. Take this time to relax and enjoy a coffee! ‚òï

<!-- 4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE:** Make sure to uncomment the following line in `api/chat/route.ts` & `api/theme/route.ts` when working in development:
>
> ```javascript
> // "http://localhost:3000",
> ``` -->

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

```env
# Development environment (all the apis are free)
EMAIL_USER="your emailid"
EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="your App Password" # get it from your Google Account settings
ABSTRACT_API_KEY="your abstract api key" # https://app.abstractapi.com/
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your openrouter api key" # https://openrouter.ai/
TAVILY_API_KEY="your Tavily api key" # https://tavily.com/

# Vector Database (Pinecone)
PINECONE_API_KEY="your Pinecone API key" # https://app.pinecone.io/
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME="your index name" # e.g., portfolio-embeddings



#jwt auth
JWT_EXPIRY="1m"
JWT_SECRET="your jwt token" # use this command for linux = "openssl rand -hex 64" or node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"  (works on windows/linux/mac)
```

## Vector Store Configuration

The vector store is configured in `lib/embeddings.ts` with the following settings:

- Dimension: 768 (Google Gemini embeddings)
- Metric: Cosine similarity
- Pod type: Starter (free tier)

You can modify these settings in the `initializeVectorStore` function if needed.
